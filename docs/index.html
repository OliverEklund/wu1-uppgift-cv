    <p>Recruiter: strawmanius Straw</p>
    <p>Job: Explosives Engieneer</p>
    <p>17165 New Mexico Santa Fe</p>
    <p>Dear Strawmanius Straw</p>
    <p>I am reaching out to you regarding the posting for the empty position as an explosives engineer at Mince-Mining
      incorporated I found in a newspaper. I am interested in this position and I would like to apply for this position
      because explosive work is my life passion, and I wish for you to consider me for this position.</p>
    
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>I have lots of experience handling explosive materials, from the years 1968 - 1970 I worked for two separate
      sibling gravel companies, (R.E.D) and (B.L.U) as a demolitions expert. I helped excavate gravel and did “Security”
      work. After R.E.D and B.L.U was assimilated into the Gray Gravel Company (G.G.C) I continued my job as a
      demolitions expert under the arms-company MANN-CO in which I helped fend off armies of robots sent by the G.G.C
      using my skills with explosives. But in early 1972 MANN-CO was fully overtaken by the G.G.C which left me jobless.
      Education: Self taught since birth.
    </p>
    <p>What makes me a good demoman? If I were a bad demoman, I wouldn't have written this now would I? But I am
      incredibly passionate about explosives, as demolition work has been a family tradition since gunpowder came to
      Scotland, which is why I have worked and want to with demolition. I am skilled in handling explosives with ease
      and precision, I am also very patient. I am also open to helping others and I am very social and outspoken. I can
      follow orders well but I can also act on my own initiative if the situation demands. I also have good endurance,
      bodily strength and an incredibly strong liver. My weaknesses lay in scrumpy and a slow running speed. These
      factors make me think I would be the perfect candidate for this position.
    </p>
    <p>There is one major health problem I face, while I can function fine with one eye lost, my old doctor said that
      consumption of non/low alcohol produce makes my body think it is being poisoned.</p>
    <p>I Appreciate your time spent reading this letter and I hope to hear from you regarding the next steps in the
      application process.</p>
    <p>Sincerely</p>
